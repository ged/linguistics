== Authors

* Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>
* Martin Chase <stillflame@FaerieMUD.org>


== Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.8.0

The following libraries are required, but are included in the redist/
directory. The installer script should install these for you if you don't
already have them.

* HashSlice - Adds slicing to the builtin Hash class


== Optional

* CrossCase - Provide auto-aliasing of camelCase to under_barred methods and
  vice-versa. (Included in redist/)

* Ruby-WordNet (>= 0.02) - adds integration for the Ruby binding for the WordNet® lexical
  reference system.

* LinkParser (>= 0.0.4) - adds integration for the Ruby Link Grammar Parser by
  Martin Chase.

== General Information

This module is a framework for building linguistic utilities for Ruby objects in
any language. It includes a generic language-independant front end, a module for
mapping language codes into language names, and a module which contains various
English-language utilities.


=== Method Interface

The Linguistics module comes with a language-independant mechanism for extending
core Ruby classes with linguistic methods. 

It consists of three parts: a core linguistics module which contains the
class-extension framework for languages, a generic inflector class that serves
as a delegator for linguistic methods on Ruby objects, and one or more
language-specific modules which contain the actual linguistic functions.

The module works by adding a single instance method for each language named
after the language's two-letter code (or three-letter code, if no two-letter
code is defined by ISO639) to various Ruby classes. This allows many
language-specific methods to be added to objects without cluttering up the
interface or risking collision between them, albeit at the cost of three or four
more characters per method invocation.

If you don't like extending core Ruby classes, the language modules should also
allow you to use them as a function library as well.

For example, the English-language module contains a #plural function which can
be accessed via a method on a core class:

  Linguistics::use( :en )
  "goose".en.plural
  # => "geese"
  
or via the Linguistics::EN::plural function directly:

  include Linguistics::EN
  plural( "goose" )
  # => "geese"

The class-extension mechanism actually uses the functional interface behind the
scenes.

A new feature with the 0.02 release: You can now omit the language-code method
for unambiguous methods by calling Linguistics::use with the +:installProxy+
configuration key, with the language code of the language module whose methods
you wish to be available. For example, instead of having to call:

  "goose".en.plural

from the example above, you can now do this:

  Lingusitics::use( :en, :installProxy => :en )
  "goose".plural
  # => "geese"

More about how this works in the documentation for Linguistics::use.


==== Adding Language Modules

To add a new language to the framework, create a file named the same as the
ISO639 2- or 3-letter language code for the language you're adding. It must be
placed under lib/linguistics/ to be recognized by the linguistics module, but
you can also just require it yourself prior to calling Linguistics::use(). This
file should define a module under Linguistics that is an all-caps version of the
code used in the filename. Any methods you wish to be exposed to users should be
declared as module functions (ie., using Module#module_function).

You may also wish to add your module to the list of default languages by adding
the appropriate symbol to the Linguistics::DefaultLanguages array.

For example, to create a Portuguese-language module, create a file called
'lib/linguistics/pt.rb' which contains the following:

  module Linguistics
    module PT
      Linguistics::DefaultLanguages << :pt

      module_function
	  <language methods here>
    end
  end

See the English language module (lib/linguistics/en.rb) for an example.


=== English Language Module

See the README.english file for a synopsis.

The English-language module currently contains linguistic functions ported from
a few excellent Perl modules:

  Lingua::EN::Inflect
  Lingua::Conjunction
  Lingua::EN::Infinitive

See the lib/linguistics/en.rb file for specific attributions.

New with version 0.02: integration with the Ruby WordNet® and LinkParser modules
(which must be installed separately).


== To Do
  
* I am planning on improving the results from the infinitive functions, which
  currently return useful results only part of the time. Investigations into
  additional stemming functions and some other strategies are ongoing.

* Martin Chase <stillflame at FaerieMUD dot org> is working on an integration
  module for his excellent work on a Ruby interface to the CMU Link Grammar (an
  english-sentence parser). This will make writing fairly accurate natural
  language parsers in Ruby much easier.

* Suggestions (and patches) for any of these items or additional features are
  welcomed.
